### A bookeeping & financial analysis engine for the Django Framework.

Djetler supports:

- Chart of Accounts.
- Financial Statements (Income Statement & Balance Sheets)
- Entities (LLC, Corps, etc.)
- General Ledgers
- Journal Entries & Transactions.
- Financial Activities Support (Operational/Financial/Investing)

Currently this project is under active development and is not recommended for production environments.
The author is working on incorporating the following functionality:

## Road Map
- Views & template tags.

## Quick Start

Django ledger currently does not ship with views as its main focus is to provide the
engine necessary to enable financially driven apps.

In order to start using Django Ledger you must create a Chart of Accounts (CoA).
Django Ledger comes with a default CoA ready to use or you could use your own. \

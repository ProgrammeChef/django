## Quick Start
Django ledger currently does not ship with views as its main focus is to provide the
engine necessary to enable financially driven apps.

In order to start using Django Ledger you must be logged in first.
Django Ledger comes with a default CoA ready to use or you could use your own.
Make sure to select the appropriate option when creating new entities.

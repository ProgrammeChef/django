    attributes mentioned below, it also has the fields/columns/attributes mentioned in the ParentChileMixin & the
    CreateUpdateMixIn. Read about these mixin here.

    Below are the fields specific to the accounts model.

    uuid : this is a unique primary key generated for the table. the default value of this field is uuid4().
    code: Each account will have its own code for e.g. Cash Account -> Code 1010 , Inventory -> 1200. Maximum Length
    allowed is 10.
    name: This is the user defined name  of the Account. the maximum length for Name of the ledger allowed is 100
    role : Each Account needs to be assigned a certain Role. The exhaustive list of ROLES is defined in io.roles.
    balance_type: Each account will have a default Account type i.e. Either Debit or Credit. For example: Assets like
    Cash, Inventory, Accounts_receivable or Expenses like Rent, Salary will have BALANCE_TYPE="Debit" Liabilities,
    Equities and Income like Payables, Loans, Income, Sales, Reserves will have BALANCE_TYPE="Credit"
    locked:This determines whether any changes can be done in the account or not. Before making any update to the
    account, the account needs to be unlocked Default value is set to False i.e. Unlocked
    active: Determines whether the concerned account is active. Any Account can be used only when it is unlocked and
    Active Default value is set to False i.e Unlocked
    coa: Each Accounts must be assigned a set of Chart_of_Accounts. By default ,one CoA will be created for each entity.
    All account created within that particular entity will all be mapped to that coa.
    on_coa: This object has been created for the purpose of the managing the models and in turn handling the database
